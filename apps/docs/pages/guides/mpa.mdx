# Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)

<Callout type="info">
Examples of MPA frameworks include Nuxt.js, Remix, and others.

## Current Status

### The Bad News
The **Vite Plugin CSP Guard** currently does not support Multi-Page Applications (MPAs). Unfortunately, this limitation is unlikely to change due to the inherent differences between how MPAs operate in Vite.

### The Good News
We are actively working on solutions to bring CSP support to MPAs. While the main plugin does not support this today, additional packages are on the way to address these needs.

## Our Roadmap
Here’s what we’re working on to support CSP in MPA environments:

1. **Build a common toolkit** (✅ Done! Check out [CSP Toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csp-toolkit)).
2. Develop **framework-specific solutions** tailored for popular MPA frameworks.
3. Create a lightweight **Vite Server solution** focused solely on attaching nonces.

## What You Can Do in the Meantime

MPAs typically have access to a server, making it feasible to implement a **nonce-based CSP**. Here’s how you can set up your CSP for MPAs:

### Steps to Implement a Nonce-Based CSP

1. **Generate a new [nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce)** on every page request.  
   *Use [CSP Toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csp-toolkit) to simplify this process.*

2. **Add the nonce to the CSP header or meta tag.**  
   Refer to the [MDN documentation on CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) for guidance on how to format the policy.

3. **Attach the nonce to your script and style tags.**  
   This ensures compliance with the CSP policy for inline scripts and styles.

## Stay Tuned

We are committed to supporting developers across all frameworks, including MPAs. Progress on our roadmap is ongoing, and you can expect updates soon. For now, implementing a nonce-based CSP is the best practice to secure your MPA.
