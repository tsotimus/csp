# Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)

<Callout type="info">
Examples of MPA frameworks include Nuxt, Remix, and others.

## Current Status

### The Bad News
The **Vite Plugin CSP Guard** package currently does not support Multi-Page Applications (MPAs). Unfortunately, this limitation is unlikely to change due to the inherent differences between how MPAs operate in Vite.

### The Good News
You should be able to use the **CSP Toolkit** to generate a nonce & a CSP policy. Check out the [CSP Toolkit documentation](https://csp-toolkit.tsotne.co.uk) for more information. It has framework specific examples for popular frameworks.
