# Creating your policy

This will hopefully help you build your CSP policy.


## Default Policies
We do this so you don't have to worry about the basics. These are merged with your custom policies.

```ts
"default-src": ["'self'"],
"img-src": ["'self'"],
"script-src-elem": ["'self'"],
"style-src-elem": ["'self'"],
```

<Callout type="info">
   You can override these defaults if you wish via the [override flag](/api-docs#override)
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
   In dev mode `"data:"` is added to `"img-src"` for your convenience 
</Callout>


## Typical use cases

#### Third party javascript

Third party code like, Google Analytics, Hotjar, etc. are common in most websites. You can use the `script-src` directive to allow these scripts to run.

<Callout type="warning">
    When doing this you are essentially trusting third party code to run on your website. Make sure you trust these third parties as you are explicitly giving them permission to run code on your site
</Callout>

```ts

import { defineConfig, PluginOption } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import csp from "vite-plugin-csp-guard";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    csp({
        policy: {
            "script-src": ["https://www.google-analytics.com"],
        }
    }),
  ],
});

```
<Callout type="info">
    Targetting a specific domain is a good way to ensure that only scripts from that domain are allowed to run. Sometimes its even better to be more specific and target a specific path on that domain, aslong as the path is unique and constant.
</Callout>

#### Third party css
Third party styles, that are injected at runtime are also common in most websites. You can use the `style-src` directive to allow these styles to be applied.


```ts

import { defineConfig, PluginOption } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import csp from "vite-plugin-csp-guard";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    csp({
        policy: {
            "style-src": ["https://example.com/styles/main.css"],
        }
    }),
  ],
});

```
